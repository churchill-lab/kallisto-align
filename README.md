Overview
--------
**kallisto-align** runs [kallisto](http://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/), processes its internal data object into an alignment incidence matrix, and exports the matrix in a pre-defined [binary format](http://churchill-lab.github.io/kallisto-align/#output) for use with other tools such as [emase](https://github.com/churchill-lab/emase) or [emase-zero](https://churchill-lab.github.io/emase-zero). It is a companion utility for our bigger project that aims to provide a suite of tools to compare, contrast, or combine the results of different alignment strategies as envisioned in our [alntools](https://churchill-lab.github.io/alntools).
